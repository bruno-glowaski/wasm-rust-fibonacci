# Rust-WASM POC project

A simple front-end for learning WebWorkers, WASM and some basic progressive
enhancement with a SSG framework.

## Features

- [x] As an average user, I want to be able to generate a sequence of Fibonacci
      numbers of any size;
- [x] As a developer, I want to be able to benchmark the algorithm;
- [ ] As an average user, I want to be able to cancel the generation midway
      through;
- [ ] As an average user, I want to be able to choose between JavaScript and
      WASM;
- [ ] As a developer, I want to be able to compare the benchmarks between
      JavaScript and WASM;
- [ ] As an user without JS enabled, I want to see an error message.

- Tailwind
